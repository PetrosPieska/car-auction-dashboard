A modern, component-driven frontend demo built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how I structure clean, reusable UI components and design intuitive interfaces for a car auction platform.


Live demo: https://petrospieska.github.io/car-auction-dashboard/



**Overview**

This demo shows a simple but modern auction dashboard with:

A real-time client-side filtering system (by make and status)

Clear visual states for auction items (Open, Ending Soon, Closed)

Reusable UI components (filters, cards, badges, layout sections)

A clean and responsive layout using Tailwind CSS

Mock data only — the focus is on UI, structure, and UX, not backend logic

The purpose is to highlight my ability to build visually polished, well-structured frontend applications.


**Tech Stack**

Vue 3 (Composition API)
TypeScript
Tailwind CSS
Vite
gh-pages for deployment


**Features**
Component-driven structure
Filters, list views, cards, and UI badges are all modular, reusable components.

**Client-side filtering**

Filters update the auction list instantly without page reloads.

**Auction state badges**

Visual indicators for each auction’s state:
OPEN
ENDING SOON
CLOSED


**Why I Built This**

This project serves as a small, focused demonstration of my frontend skills:

UI architecture
Component design
Tailwind layout and styling
Visual clarity and UX thinking
Modern Vue 3 + TypeScript workflow

The scope is intentionally small so you can quickly scan the code and UI.

Responsive design
Works on desktop and mobile, thanks to Tailwind’s utility-first layout system.

Clean visual hierarchy
Focus on typography, spacing, and clarity to make auctions easy to scan.
